Python Frist day Operator :
python_codes

A simple repository of Python scripts demonstrating basic arithmetic and mathematical operations.
This repo is useful for beginners learning Python operators, power operations, modular arithmetic, and related concepts.

🚀 Features

Examples of addition, subtraction, exponentiation, floor operations, modular arithmetic, etc.

Clean, focused scripts illustrating one concept per file.

Easy to understand — good for learners and for referencing operator usage.

📂 File Structure
Filename	Purpose / Description
Addition_operator.py	Demonstrates addition of numbers
Subtraction_poer.py	Showcases subtraction operations
Exponentiation_poer.py	Uses Python’s exponentiation operator (**)
Floor_oper.py	Demonstrates floor division or related floor operator
Moduals_oper.py	Shows modular arithmetic (remainder) operations
README.md	This readme file describing the repo

🧵 String Operations

-This repository now includes examples of common string operations in Python:
-string_concatenation.py: Demonstrates how to concatenate strings using the + operator.
-string_repetition.py: Shows how to repeat strings using the * operator.
-string_slicing.py: Illustrates how to slice strings to extract substrings.
-string_methods.py: Provides examples of various string methods like upper(), lower(), replace(), and more.

Note: Some filenames include typos (e.g. “poer” instead of “power”, “Moduals” instead of “Modulus”). You may want to rename them for clarity.
🧩 Usage

Just clone or download the repository, and run any of the .py files using Python:

git clone https://github.com/Chetan9560/python_codes.git
cd python_codes
python3 Addition_operator.py
